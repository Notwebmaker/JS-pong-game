Slighlty modified code of Tacktel's JS Pong game, not many changes, just that the keycode function for detcting keypresses has been replaced with the event.key function to ensure compatability with newer browsers			
Also the left player has been changed from 'S'= down and "Z" (probably for the dvorak keyboard) == up to 'W'=up and 'S'=down... That's about it
